# Udacity Nanodree project 

This project is regarding my knowledge of a simpler version of an old-fashioned text-based adventure game using python. 
The game gives users a description of what's happening, and then asks them to make a choice.
Something different happens depending on the choice the user made.
The game also includes some random factors, so that it's a little different each time.
The game has conditions for winning and losing.
When the game is over, it asks if the user wants to play again.
